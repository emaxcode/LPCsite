            <p> I recognize the choice to begin counseling can be a huge step for many people, and hold great respect
                for anyone
                with the courage to try.<br>
                <br>

                I strive to provide each of my client’s with a customized approach, which I develop using a variety
                of
                modalities centered on each person’s needs.
               
                I’m dedicated to helping you rediscover what is holding you back from living the life you desire and
                having the
                healthy relationships you deserve. My clients often find our sessions to be a balance of
                lightheartedness and
                deep honesty. I also bring warmth, humanity and humor into the relationships formed with my clients.
                I work to
                discern the dynamics between your thoughts, feelings and behaviors in a collaborative and authentic
                manner and
                fully understand the courage and bravery attending counseling requires. Everyone needs assistance in
                our lives,
                the time to make positive change is now!
                <br>
                <br>
                My journey to becoming a therapist is filled with a few twists and turns. I have almost a decade of
                experience
                as a State and Federal Probation/Pretrial Services Officer and served as the Drug and Alcohol
                Treatment
                Specialist for the District of Arizona. It was my inquisitive nature and free spirit that led me to
                a career
                change, providing technology and sales support to three different Fortune 500 companies. Even though
                I gained
                valuable experience in both the private and public sector, it was the drive to be a therapist that
                kept calling
                me and I have never regretted being true to myself. Helping people get through difficult situations
                in their
                lives is my passion! I can’t promise you miracles; however, I will promise to give you my best.
