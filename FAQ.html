                    <b> What is counseling?</b>

                </ul>
                <p> In my opinion, counseling at its basic form is a commitment and investment in yourself or your
                    relationship. It takes time, energy and costs money. Some parts will be fun, some uncomfortable.
                    Most
                    importantly I think of counseling as a process in which you are allowed to feel vulnerable and
                    safe at
                    the same time. You can heal parts of your past. You can become more secure and confident. You
                    can
                    establish healthy boundaries with those around you. You can have a healthy and supportive
                    relationship.
                    You can become whole and happy. </p>

                <ul> <b>What is it like to be in counseling?</ul></b>
                <p>Each of us are unique. We have led different lives, experienced different ups- different downs.
                    My
                    weakness may be your strength and vice versa. Because no 2 of us are the same, the process of
                    counseling
                    will not be. That being said there are common threads; you will not be judged and you won't feel
                    alone.
                </p>
                <ul><b>
                        Why should I see a therapist/counselor?</ul></b>
                <p>Counseling isn't for everyone nor is it essential to go every week for your whole life. If you
                    come in to
                    counseling and don't feel like it's for you, that is completely fine. Some will get more benefit
                    from
                    different avenues of support. I at the very least can help you with other resources or ideas
                    about how
                    to get the help you deserve.
                </p>
                <ul><b>How does counseling work?</ul></b>
                <p>Rarely are our minds calm and settled. We think about millions of things each and every day. We
                    compare
                    our lives to others, we are inundated with information about how we should look, what we should
                    buy, how
                    we should feel. Add in anxiety, depression, or low self-esteem to the mix and it's not difficult
                    to
                    imagine becoming overwhelmed. My first priority is to never let
                    you
                    feel judged for what you say in a counseling session and to never let you feel alone in this
                    journey.
